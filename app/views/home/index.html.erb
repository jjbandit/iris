							<h1>Overview</h1>
							<p><i>
								Iris Dynamics produces precision motion control systems that are transforming
								how people interact with machines of all types.
							</i></p>
							<p>
								Our patent-pending technology provides haptic feedback and control loading technology
								at a dramatically lower cost. The core technology is ideally suited for flight simulation,
								as well as remote operation applications in aerospace equipment, submersibles, vehicles
								and heavy machinery.

							Iris Dynamics has developed a motion control system using programmable electro-magnetic
							induction to emulate physical forces and provide smooth force feedback to the operator.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other control systems are traditionally quite expensive as they rely on complex mechanical
							gears, pulleys, pneumatic and/or hydraulic systems with many moving parts.  Because of their
							cost and complexity these systems are typically used on very expensive industrial simulation
							equipment such as found on full motion aircraft simulators. The Iris Dynamics Actuator eamlessly
							integrates programamble electro-magnetics and hardware technologies to provide smoother and
							superior performance, with few moving parts, and most importantly, at a fraction of the cost.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<h4><i>
								"Iris Dynamics' solution is a mechanically simple design with a single moving part, which translates
								to reduced costs, higher reliability, and operation in challenging environments. It feels natural
								and real like flying an actual aircraft."

								Iris Dynamics uses state-of-the-art technology to bring you the feel of an aircraft in a flight
								simulator like you have never felt before.  This represents the first significant innovation in
								"control loading" technology in many years.

							<p>
								In flight simulators for pilot training, existing control systems are often "one-way,‚Äù meaning
								external forces applied aerodynamically to the control surfaces of a plane are not felt at the
								controls.  It is important to provide the force feedback that would be felt in actual operations
								of the aircraft to properly prepare students and pilots for reality.  In other control systems,
								the missing forces are simulated with gears, pulleys, and springs which use many moving parts
								and have high failure rates and steep costs.

							This new class of tactile motion control systems with force feedback is adaptable and scalable,
							with applications in a wide variety of industries.
							Iris Dynamics is currently working on various tactile teleoperation projects.
